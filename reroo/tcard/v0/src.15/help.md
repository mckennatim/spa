Developed for Restoring Roots Coop by Tim McKenna, this app should make entering timecards quick and painless. It will be worth the the climb to the top of the learning curve.

#### registering
You are identified by your email address in this app. If you log in with google or facebook they will send the app the email address you use with them. That's got to match the email address that the Restoring Roots Admin has put in for you. Otherwise let the Admin know so they can change your emailid or do a local signup.

#### ios quirks

When punching in or out you need to click on the time, spin the tumblers then hit `DONE`.  Done doesn't punch in the time, you have to then hit  `punch in` or  `punch out`. Too bad. 

You cannot do the sensible thing and `Add to Home Screen` from Safari. It will show up but the connection to the key used in authentication is lost. Instead you will need to bookmark the app in your browser.

#### android
supports Progressive Web Apps and so `Add to Home Screen` works and is a good idea. Also, when you are punching in our out and the time selector comes up, hitting `SET` will actually puch you in or out. No other button push is required.
