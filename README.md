#### on embedding a timer_ctrl

A heating system app would have one or more locations in a house. The main page would have basic data for the house (location, temp, setpt, ison, lastchange).

_The house could be comprised of 1 or more esp8266s, each with one or more sensors/relays (senrels)._

Clicking on a location, switched you to a page that allows you to boost or hold a location. Details might include the current day's schedule.

Clicking on todays schedule takes you to a __timer_ctrl__.

Clicking on schedule takes you to a table that lists the overall schedule: by day, everyday, weekend, weekday, for_date. From there, clicking on anything but for_date takes you to __timer_ctrl__. Schedule also has a copy_to button to copy schedule to other locations.

_to mock it <sb-timr-ctrl sched={sched} schedChanged={handleSchedChange}> gets placed in a page that has state and passes a schedule array as props. __timer_ctrl__ messes with that schedule until it gets it right and then schedChanged gets called with an sched object returned  _

__timr_ctrl__ takes an object like

    raw: [
        [0,0,59],
        [9,10,74],
        [9,40,62],
        [17,0,68],
        [22,30,58]
    ]

and transforms it to

    decans: {
        g1: [0.0, 9.13, 59],
        g2: [9.13, 9.66, 74],
        g3: [9.66, 17.00, 62],
        g4: [17.00, 22.33, 67],
        g5: [22.33, 0.0, 58]
    }

and then draws that. Modifying the cornerGrabs changes the associated object  

### 01-rxrena-admind-aapoj
moved up to react 16.1.1, rxjs 5.5, navigo5.3.3, paho.mqtt.js 2.0.5
got rid of createClass in Devinf.js so admind would run. brought over just the basic active stuff from spas

## review of rxasred
Ok so at the heart of things:

    action$.scan(reducer).subscribe(renderer)

    action$ is an observable stream.  

an actionCreator takes a payload and returns an object `{type:'SOMEACTION',payload:payload}`. Defining an action means giving it a name and a type. ActionCreator then throws this action on the action$ stream which takes the action and state and puts it through the reducer to create a new state. That state has been subscribed to so that the render function of react is called every time state changes

        const action$ = new Subject();

        const createStore = (initState) =>
          action$
            .flatMap((action) => isObservable(action) ? action : Observable.from([action]))
            .startWith(initState)
            .scan(rootReducer);

        const actionCreator = (func) => (...args) => {
          const action = func.call(null, ...args);
          action$.next(action);
          if (isObservable(action.payload))
            action$.next(action.payload);
          return action;
        };

    const changeName = actionCreator((payload) => ({
      type: 'NAME_CHANGED',
      payload
    }));

### apply, call and bind review
http://javascriptissexy.com/javascript-apply-call-and-bind-methods-are-essential-for-javascript-professionals/
Bind () Allows us to Borrow Methods
the first argument of bind sets 'this'

    $("button").click (user.clickHandler.bind (user));

You need .bind(user) because otherwise it expects button to have a user.clickHandler method. .bind(user) says the function is actually here(in user)

Bind Allows Us to Curry a Functionâ€¨
The remaining arguments of bind can be stepped over and selectively reset. Below, the first argument(after this) is "" is skipped over and the second argument is preset to 16.



    var greetAnAdultMale = greet.bind (null, "", 16);




We can create a function that presets one or more of the parameters of another function.


### common issues
- DO use .babelrc for all babel presets and stuff. Now mocha can access it
- DO use a `test/mocha.opts` with at least `--compilers js:../node_modules/babel-register` and do give the path to where the node_modules really are
- DO try new stuff in local node_moodules then move them here and fix what needs fixing
- DON'T run npm global stuff. To get to the binary for cli do something like `node ../node_modules/webpack/bin/webpack` to run the latest version
- DON'T assume you have loaded enough babel presets to actually use all es6 features. DO on error first look for a babel preset before you assume some other problem
